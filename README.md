8-17-18 Created the completed version of Compare Rubric. I don't know how to use GitHub yet, so I uploaded the completed version as a new repository, rather than committing the changes I made today. I'm very happy with the results, though. I've learned a lot this year, and even more every time I turn on my class videos from LinkedIn Learning. I guess I'd better keep it going, huh?
8-16-18 Created Compare Rubric and added it as a repository. Only visual components were added today.
